# Active Context

Purpose: Capture current focus areas and any in-flight tasks for ProjectAtlas.

- Ship v0.1.8 with auto-detected language extensions in `projectatlas init` (issue #111).
- Confirm docs/skills/CLI remain aligned with the auto-detect behavior after the release.
- Keep CI green and close out any resolved release issues with self-review notes.
