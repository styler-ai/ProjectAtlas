# Contributing

Thanks for the interest in ProjectAtlas. At the moment, we are not accepting external code contributions.

If you spot a bug or have a suggestion, please open an issue with clear reproduction steps or a concrete proposal.

## Internal workflow

- Feature work lands on `dev`.
- Releases are merged from `dev` into `main` via PR.
- CI checks must pass before merge.
